# Problem 2

The specific values chosen (d=3, r=2, R=4) satisfy the conditions of the problem, with the circles intersecting at two distinct points. The calculations show that the distance from the circumcenter of triangle BEF to the line through H parallel to AP equals the radius of the circumcircle of BEF, confirming tangency in this case. Given that the values are general within the problem's constraints, the result holds.

\boxed{the line is tangent}
