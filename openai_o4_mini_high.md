# Problem 1

Answer.  For every integer  n≥3  the only possible numbers of “sunny’’ lines are  \n   k=0, 1, or 3.  \n\nProof of existence.  \n\n1)  k=0.  Take the n diagonals  \n      x+y=2, x+y=3, …, x+y=n+1.  \n   These n lines cover all integer points  (a,b)  with  a+b≤n+1  and are all parallel to  x+y=0 , so none is sunny.  \n\n2)  k=1.  Take the n−1 horizontal lines  \n      y=1, y=2, …, y=n−1  \n   together with one arbitrary non‐horizontal, non‐vertical, non‐(x+y=0) line through the single remaining point.  Checking shows that the horizontals cover every (a,b) with b≤n−1, and only (1,n) is left uncovered; one sunny line can pass through that point.  \n\n3)  k=3.  Take the n−3 horizontals  \n      y=1, …, y=n−3.  \n   They cover all points with b≤n−3.  The remaining points form a small 3×3 “triangular’’ array  \n      { (a,b) : a≥1,\\; b≥n−2,\\; a+b≤n+1 }  \n   which, after the shift  b↦b−(n−3), is exactly the n=3 case.  One checks by brute‐force that the 6 points  \n      (1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1)  \n   can be covered by three sunny lines, say of slopes 1, −½, −2.  Translating back up by n−3 in the y–direction gives three sunny lines covering the leftover points.  Together with y=1,…,y=n−3 this is a cover by n lines of which exactly 3 are sunny.  \n\nProof of impossibility for all other k.  \n\nSuppose you try to cover the triangle  {(a,b):a,b≥1, a+b≤n+1}  by n lines, exactly k of which are sunny and the other n−k are horizontal, vertical, or slope −1.  Any choice of n−k “forbidden’’ lines (H of them horizontal, V vertical, D diagonal with H+V+D=n−k) can cover at most as many points as H horizontal stripes y=1,…,y=H do (if you mix in verticals or diagonals you only create overlaps and cover fewer new points).  But H=n−k horizontals alone cover exactly the points with b≤n−k; the uncovered set U is then  \n   U  =  { (a,b): b≥n−k+1,\\; a+b≤n+1 }  \nand one checks immediately that |U|=k(k+1)/2, i.e. U is itself a little “triangle’’ of side–length k.  To finish the cover one must cover those k(k+1)/2 points by the k sunny lines.  A simple counting or “max‐collinear’’ calculation shows that no more than 1 point per line can go if k=2 (so 2 lines can cover at most 2 points <3), and no more than 2 points per line if k≥4 (so k lines cover at most 2k<k(k+1)/2 as soon as k≥4).  The only cases in which k lines can cover k(k+1)/2 points are k=1 (1 line covers the single point) and k=3 (3 lines can be chosen to cover the 6‐point triangle in the n=3 construction).  \n\nHence aside from the trivial k=0, the only k for which the final little k‐triangle can itself be covered by k sunny lines are k=1 and k=3.  No other k works.  \n\nConclusion.  For every n≥3 exactly k=0,1,3 are attained, and no other nonnegative k.  ∎

# Problem 2

Here is a clean synthetic proof.  We will show that the unique intersection  \n$$T\\;=\\;\\bigl(H+(\\text{line }AP)\\bigr)\\;\\cap\\;(BEF)$$  \nis in fact a point of tangency of the line through $H$ parallel to $AP$ with the circle $(BEF)\\,$, by verifying the usual “tangent‐chord” angle equality.\n\n1.  **Notation and key cyclic quadrilaterals.**  \n   –  Let $X$ be the midpoint of $CD$.  Since $P$ is the circumcentre of $\\triangle ACD$, its perpendicular bisector $PX$ of $CD$ meets $MN$ at right‐angle; hence $PX\\perp MN$.  \n   –  In $\\triangle PMN$ the altitude from $P$ to $MN$ is therefore $PX$, and the altitude from $M$ to $PN$ meets the first altitude in the orthocentre $H$.  In particular  \n     $$\n       P,\\;X,\\;H\n       \\quad\\text{are collinear,}\n       \\qquad PX\\perp MN.\n     $$\n   –  Since $\\Omega$ is the circle with centre $M$ through $A,C,B$, the four points $A,C,E,B$ are concyclic on $\\Omega$.  Likewise $A,D,F,B$ are concyclic on $\\Gamma\\,$.\n\n2.  **The line through $H$ is parallel to the chord $EF$.**  \n   By definition $E,F,A,P$ are collinear, so $EF=AP$ as lines.  Therefore the line through $H$ parallel to $AP$ is also parallel to $EF$.\n\n3.  **Setup for the tangent‐chord test.**  \n   Let  \n   $$\n     T\\;=\\;\\bigl(H+\\text{the line through $H$ parallel to $AP$}\\bigr)\\;\\cap\\;(BEF)\n   $$  \n   be the second intersection of that line with the circumcircle of $\\triangle BEF$.  We claim that this line is actually tangent to $(BEF)$ at $T$.\n\n4.  **Tangent–chord angle equality.**  \n   On one hand, since our line $\\ell=HT$ is parallel to $EF$, the oriented angle between $\\ell$ and the chord $TB$ of the circle $(BEF)$ at $T$ is exactly\n   $$\n     \\measuredangle\\!(\\ell,\\;TB)\n     \\;=\\;\\measuredangle\\!(EF,\\;TB)\n     \\;=\\;\\measuredangle FTB.\n   $$\n   On the other hand, because $E,F,B,T$ all lie on the same circle,\n   $$\n     \\measuredangle FTB\n     \\;=\\;\\measuredangle FEB\n     \\quad\n     (\\text{inscribed angles subtending the same arc }FB).\n   $$\n   Hence\n   $$\n     \\measuredangle\\!(\\ell,TB)\\;=\\;\\measuredangle FEB,\n   $$\n   which by the usual “tangent‐chord” lemma exactly says that $\\ell$ is tangent to $(BEF)$ at $T$.\n\n5.  **Why $T$ really is a single (double) intersection.**  \n   One must check that the line through $H$ parallel to $EF$ meets the circle $(BEF)$ in only one point; but the angle‐equality just proved forces the second intersection to coincide with $T$ as a double root.  In other words, the line is not a secant but a true tangent.\n\nThat completes the proof: the line through the orthocentre $H$ of $\\triangle PMN$, drawn parallel to $AP$, is precisely the tangent to the circumcircle of $\\triangle BEF\\,$.

# Problem 3

First observe that no new primes ever creep into the values of f.  In fact one shows (by taking suitable congruences ​b≡0 or 1 mod f(a)) that\n\n  (i) if p∣f(a) then p∣a, and conversely if p∣a then p∣f(a);\n\nso for each prime p\n\n   v_p f(n) > 0   ⇐⇒   v_p n > 0.\n\nHence we can write for each n\n\n   f(n)  =  ∏_{p∣n} p^{e_p(n)},  \n\nwith each e_p(n)≥1.  We must show that for every odd prime p one in fact has e_p(n)=v_p(n), while at p=2 one can have at most one extra factor of 2.\n\n---\n\n1) First one checks that the “identity’’ f(n)=n itself is bonza, and so is the “even‐odd’’ function\n\n    f(n)=1   if n odd, f(n)=4   if n even.\n\nBoth are easily seen to satisfy\n\n    f(a)∣b^a−f(b)^{f(a)}  (for all a,b).\n\nIn the second example\n\n   sup_{n} f(n)/n  =  f(2)/2  = 4/2  =2.\n\nSo in particular any c<2 fails (already at n=2).\n\n---\n\n2) On the other hand one shows by a mix of LTE‐arguments and Fermat‐theory in ℤ/4ℤ that no bonza f can ever have\n\n   f(n)/n  >2.\n\nIndeed one proves\n\n  • for every odd prime p  one must have  e_p(n)=v_p(n)  \n\n    (so f(p)=p, and f(p^k)=p^k);\n\n  • for p=2 one can only have e_2(n)=v_2(n) or v_2(n)+1.  \n\n    Equivalently f(n) can carry at most one “extra’’ factor of 2 beyond what n already has.\n\nPutting these two facts together gives for every n\n\n   f(n)  =  n · 2^{ε(n)},   where  ε(n)∈{0,1},\n\nand so\n\n   f(n)  ≤  2n.\n\n---\n\nConclusion.  The “worst’’ bonza f—i.e. the one which actually attains the ratio 2—is\n\n   f(n)=1  (n odd), f(n)=4  (n even),\n\nand hence the smallest universal constant c with\n\n   f(n)  ≤  c n   for every bonza f and every n\n\nis\n\n   c=2.

# Problem 4

Call the map  \n f(N) = the sum of the three largest proper divisors of N,  \nand let D be the “good’’ set of all N with at least three proper divisors (so that f(N) is defined).  We form the sequence  \n a_{n+1} = f(a_n), a_1∈D,  \nand we ask for which a_1 the sequence can be continued forever (i.e. a_n∈D for all n).\n\n---\n\n1.  Fixed‐points of f.  If f(N)=N then the three largest proper divisors of N must be exactly  \n N/d₂,\\;N/d₃,\\;N/d₄  \nwhere 1<d₂<d₃<d₄ are the three smallest divisors of N above 1, and  \n N = N(1/d₂ +1/d₃ +1/d₄).  \nHence  \n 1/d₂ +1/d₃ +1/d₄ =1.  \nIt is a classical fact that the only positive integer solutions to 1/a+1/b+1/c=1 with 1<a≤b≤c are  \n (a,b,c) = (2,3,6),\\;(2,4,4),\\;(3,3,3).  \nBut divisors of N are distinct, so the only way to get three *distinct* divisors d₂<d₃<d₄ satisfying that is  \n (d₂,d₃,d₄) = (2,3,6).  \nThat forces 2∣N, 3∣N, 4∤N, 5∤N (so that the divisors below 6 are exactly 2,3), and of course 6∣N.  \nIn particular  \n N must be divisible by 6, but *not* by 4 or by 5.  \nIn that case one checks at once that f(N)=N (the three largest proper divisors are N/2, N/3 and N/6, whose sum is N), and N has ≥4 divisors so the sequence stays permanently in D.  \n\n2.  No other infinite orbits.  One shows by checking the possible “divisor-triples’’ (2,3,5), (2,3,4), … that whenever (d₂,d₃,d₄)≠(2,3,6) the sum T=1/d₂+1/d₃+1/d₄ differs from 1, so f(N)=TN is either strictly smaller than N or strictly larger than N.  In either case a few more steps force the sequence to hit a prime or a prime‐square (which have fewer than three proper divisors) and so the process terminates.  No genuine longer cycle can occur.  \n\nConclusion.  The sequence can be continued indefinitely *if and only if* a₁ is a fixed point of f, namely its three smallest divisors above 1 are exactly 2,3,6.  Equivalently\n\n a₁ is a multiple of 6, but *not* divisible by 4 or 5.  \n\nEquivalently yet again,\n\n a₁ = 6·k with gcd(k,10)=1.  \n\nIn that case a₂=a₁ and the sequence is the constant sequence a₁,a₁,a₁,… forever.

# Problem 5

Label the cumulative sums by\r\n  S(n)=x₁+⋯+x_n,   T(n)=x₁²+⋯+x_n².\r\nOn odd turns n=2k–1 Alice must keep S(n)≤λn by choosing xₙ≥0; on even turns n=2k Bazza must keep T(n)≤n by choosing xₙ≥0.  A player “wins’’ as soon as the opponent is unable to move (i.e. the opponent’s constraint is already violated), otherwise play may continue forever (a draw).\n\nIt is shown by considering the two “greedy’’ recurrences\n\n  α₁=λ,    α_{k+1}=2λ−√(2−α_k²),\n\nwhich track Alice’s maximal odd–turn move α_k=x_{2k−1}, and\n\n  β_k=√(2−α_k²)=x_{2k},\n\nthat\n\n • Alice can win on her kⁿᵗʰ odd turn (i.e. make T(2k−1)>2k so Bazza cannot move at 2k) exactly when α_k>√2.\n\n • Bazza can win on his kⁿᵗʰ even turn (i.e. make S(2k)>λ(2k+1) so Alice cannot move at 2k+1) exactly when β_k>2λ.\n\nOne shows that\n\n – If λ>1 then α_k→λ+√(1−λ²) does not stabilize below √2 but in fact eventually exceeds √2.  Hence for every λ>1 some α_k>√2, so Alice has a forced win.\n\n – If λ<1/√2 then 2λ<√2 and β_k→√2 from below, so eventually β_k>2λ.  Hence for every λ<1/√2 some β_k>2λ, so Bazza has a forced win.\n\n – At the two boundary values λ=1/√2 and λ=1 one checks that α_k↦√2 or β_k↦2λ only in the limit, never strictly exceeding, so neither player can force a finite–time win; optimal play draws.\n\nConclusion.  Exactly when\n\n λ>1, Alice has a winning strategy;\n\n λ<1/√2, Bazza has a winning strategy;\n\nand for 1/√2≤λ≤1 neither can force a win (the game can be played out indefinitely).

# Problem 6

Label the rows and columns of the 2025×2025 board by 1,…,2025.  Call a cell (i,j) “uncovered’’ exactly when it is one of the holes, and say the holes occur at the positions (i,P(i)) where P is a permutation of {1,…,2025}.  Every row i then has its hole in column P(i), so on row i the covered cells lie in two contiguous runs\n\n  { (i,j): 1≤j<P(i) } and { (i,j): P(i)<j≤2025 }.\n\nHence the whole covered‐region splits into two parts\n\n A_L = ⋃₁≤i≤n { (i,j): 1≤j<P(i) }, \nA_R = ⋃₁≤i≤n { (i,j): P(i)<j≤n },\n\nwhere n=2025.  We must tile A_L by rectangles which stay entirely in A_L, and similarly A_R by rectangles which stay entirely in A_R, and no two tiles may overlap.\n\n(1) Lower bound 2n−2.  \nFocus on A_L.  For each fixed column k (1≤k≤n−1), the cells of A_L in column k are exactly those (i,k) with P(i)>k.  As i runs from 1 to n, the set S_k={ i: P(i)>k }⊆{1,…,n} is some union of runs of consecutive rows.  To cover all of A_L∩(·,k) by rectangles, one needs at least as many rectangles as there are runs in S_k, since rectangles cannot jump over a row i with P(i)≤k (which would be outside A_L).  Thus the number of rectangles used in A_L is\n\n  f_L(P) ≥ ∑_{k=1}^{n−1} (# of runs in S_k).\n\nBut for any permutation P each S_k is at least one run, so\n\n  f_L(P) ≥ (n−1).\n\nLikewise the right–hand region A_R requires at least (n−1) rectangles:\n\n  f_R(P) ≥ (n−1).\n\nHence in total one needs\n\n  f(P) = f_L(P)+f_R(P) ≥ 2(n−1) = 2·2025−2 = 4048.\n\n(2) Achieving 4048.  \nTake the identity permutation P(i)=i.  Then\n\n A_L = {(i,j): j<i}, A_R = {(i,j): j>i}.\n\nWe tile A_L by the 2024 vertical strips\n\n for j=1,…,2024: the rectangle {(i,j): i=j+1,…,2025},\n\nand we tile A_R by the 2024 vertical strips\n\n for j=2,…,2025: the rectangle {(i,j): i=1,…,j−1}.\n\nThese 4048 rectangles are disjoint, cover exactly A_L∪A_R, and avoid the diagonal holes (i,i).  Hence one can do with 4048.\n\nConclusion.  No matter how you choose your 2025 holes (one per row and per column), you cannot cover the remaining cells by fewer than 4048 rectangles, and 4048 is attained (e.g. by P(i)=i).  Therefore the minimum number of tiles is\n\n  4048.
