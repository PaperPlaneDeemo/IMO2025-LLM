 # IMO2025-LLM

This project is a collection and evaluation of solutions to the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems, with a focus on large language model (LLM) performance. It includes the official IMO 2025 problems, detailed solutions and reasoning generated by various LLMs, and a structured evaluation of their correctness and completeness.

## Project Structure
- `imo_2025_evaluation.json` â€” Structured evaluation of each model's answers, including token usage, cost, and correctness.

## Purpose

- To provide a public dataset of IMO 2025 problems and LLM-generated solutions.
- To benchmark and compare the mathematical reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs.

## Usage

You can use this repository to:
- Review the IMO 2025 problems and their solutions by different LLMs.
- Extend the dataset with new models or additional analysis.
