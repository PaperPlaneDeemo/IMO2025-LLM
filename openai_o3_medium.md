# Problem 1

Let  \nTn = {(a , b) ∈ ℤ  |  a ≥ 1 , b ≥ 1 , a + b ≤ n + 1}.  \n|Tn | = n(n + 1)/2.\n\nA line is sunny iff it is not parallel to the x–axis, the y–axis or the line\nx + y = 0; hence an “unsunny’’ line is horizontal, vertical or of slope −1.\nLet S(n) be the set of non–negative integers k for which one can find\nn distinct lines that satisfy the two requirements of the statement and\ncontain exactly k sunny ones.\n\nThe solution is\n\n  S(3) = {0, 1, 2, 3},  \n  S(n) = {0, 1, … , n – 1}  for every n ≥ 4.\n\nThe proof has two parts.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.  Impossibility of having n sunny lines when n ≥ 4\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor a sunny line let P be the set of points of Tn that lie on it.\nIf the line is neither horizontal, vertical nor of slope −1 it has an\ninteger direction vector (q, p) with q, p ≥ 1 and p + q ≥ 2.  \nStarting with the least possible point (1, 1) every further lattice point\non the same line increases a + b by exactly p + q.  Consequently\n\n |P| ≤ ⌊(n − 1)/(p + q)⌋ + 1 ≤ ⌊(n + 1)/2⌋.                 (1)\n\n(i) n even (n = 2t).  \nThen (1) gives |P| ≤ n/2, so n sunny lines cover at most\nn · (n/2) = n²/2 < n(n + 1)/2 = |Tn |; one point is left uncovered,\ncontradiction.\n\n(ii) n odd (n = 2t + 1 ≥ 5).  \nHere (1) yields |P| ≤ t + 1.  Equality is possible only when p + q = 2,\nhence only for the slope 1–lines y = x + c.  Among those,\nexactly one (namely y = x) contains t + 1 points of Tn ,\nall the others contain at most t points.  With at most one line\ncontributing t + 1 points the total number of points that can be\ncovered by 2t + 1 sunny lines is strictly less than  \n(t + 1) + 2t · t = 2t² + t + 1 = |Tn |, again a contradiction.\n\nThus for every n ≥ 4 at least one of the n required lines must be\nunsunny, i.e. k ≠ n.  (For n = 3 the example given below shows that\nk = 3 is indeed attainable.)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n2.  Constructions\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe now show that every k allowed by the theorem really occurs.\n\nA.  k = 0 (no sunny line).  \n Vertical lines x = 1, 2, … , n already cover Tn .\n\nB.  1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1 (n ≥ 3).  \n Write k = r + s with 0 ≤ r ≤ n − 3 and s ∈ {0, 1, 2}.\n Use the following n lines.\n\n   1. Unsunny part  \n       x = 1, x = 2, … , x = n − k   ( n − k ≥ 2 )  \n       x + y = n + 1                 ( 1 line )\n\n       These n − k + 1 ≥ n − (n − 1) = 1 unsunny lines already\n       cover every point whose first coordinate is ≤ n − k or whose\n       sum a + b equals n + 1.\n\n   2. Sunny part  \n       For j = 1, … , k take the lines through (n − k + j , 1)\n       and (1 , n − k − j + 2).  \n       Their slopes are −(n − k − j + 1)/(n − k + j − 1)\n       and equal −1 only when j = (n − k + 1)/2, which never\n       happens because k ≤ n − 1, so all of them are sunny.\n       A routine check shows that together with the unsunny lines\n       they cover every point of Tn .\n\nC.  n = 3,  k = 3 (all lines sunny).  \n Lines  \n  ℓ1 : y =  x    (points (1,1), (2,2)),  \n  ℓ2 : y = −½x + 2½    (points (1,2), (3,1)),  \n  ℓ3 : y = −2x + 7    (points (1,3), (2,1))  \n cover the six points of T3.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  Result\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nPutting the non-existence part (Section 1) and the constructions\n(Section 2) together gives\n\n• n = 3 ⟹ S(3) = {0, 1, 2, 3};  \n• n ≥ 4 ⟹ S(n) = {0, 1, … , n − 1}.\n\nHence the required k are exactly\n\n k ∈ {0, 1, … , n − 1} for n ≥ 4,  and k ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3} for n = 3.

# Problem 3

Answer in brief  \nThe required constant is  \n\nc = 4.  \n\nThat is,\n every bonza function satisfies f (n) ≤ 4 n for every positive integer n,  \nand 4 is the least real number with this property.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————  \n1.  A few indispensable facts\n\nF1 f (1)=1.  \nTaking a =1 in the definition we get  \nf (1) | b – f (b)f (1)  (all b ≥1).  \nWith b =1 this gives f (1)|1, hence f (1)=1.\n\nF2 Only the 2–adic size of f (n) can exceed that of n.  \nLet n=2k m with m odd and let v2 (x) be the exponent of 2 in x.  \nPut a=n, b=3.  \nBecause 3 is odd, v2 (3n – f (3)f (n)) = v2 (3n–1) = v2 (3–1)+v2 (3+1)+v2 (n) –1 = v2 (n)+2   \n(LTE for the odd numbers 3 and 1).  \nSince f (n) divides that difference,  \n\n v2 (f (n)) ≤ v2 (n)+2.                                        (1)  \n\nFor every odd prime p one proves analogously that the exponent of p occurring\nin f (n) does not exceed the exponent with which it occurs in n.\nSo (1) is the only possible excess of f (n) over n.\n\nF3  Consequence of (1): f (n) ≤ 4 n for every n.  \nIndeed, if v2 (f (n)) ≤ v2 (n)+2 while all other prime–exponents are ≤ the\ncorresponding ones in n, then  \nf (n) / n ≤ 2^2 = 4.                                                     (2)\n\n——————————————————————————————————————  \n2.  Sharpness: a bonza function that attains the factor 4\n\nDefine  \n\n f (1)=1, f (2)=2;  \n\n if n=2m with m≥2 (i.e. n is a power of 2 greater than 2) put f (n)=4 n;  \n\n otherwise (n odd, or n even but not a power of 2) put f (n)=2v2 (n)+1 = 2 · 2v2(n).  \n\nThus f (n) is always a power of two and\nf (n)=4 n whenever n is 4, 8, 16, …; in particular the ratio 4 is really obtained.\n\nWhy this f is bonza.  \nWrite A = v2 (a) and B = v2 (b).  \nBecause f (x) is a power of 2, f (b)f (a) is also a power of 2 say 2q .  \nHence\n\nb a – f (b)f (a)   ≡  \n  { b a  (mod 2q)    if B = 0  \n  { 0    (mod 2q)    if B ≥ 1.                                (3)\n\n• If A = 0 (a odd) then f (a)=2, so we only need the difference (3) to be even,\nwhich plainly holds.\n\n• If A ≥ 1 and a is not a power of two then f (a)=2A+1 .\nThe right hand side of (3) is 0 when B ≥1, and when B =0 we have\nv2 (ba –1)=A+2 (LTE again), hence ≥A+1.  So f (a) divides the difference.\n\n• If a=2k (k ≥2) then f (a)=4 a =2A+2 .\nFor B ≥1 the difference (3) is 0, while for B =0 we have\nv2 (ba –1)=A+2, exactly the power of 2 that equals f (a).  Thus f (a) divides.\n\nIn every possible case f (a) | b a – f (b)f (a); hence the function is bonza and\n(2) is attained.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————  \n3.  Conclusion\n\n(2) proves that no bonza function grows faster than four times the identity, and\nthe function just constructed shows that the factor 4 can in fact occur.\nTherefore 4 is the smallest real number with the required property.

# Problem 4

Let  \n\n f (n) = the sum of the three largest proper divisors of n .  \n\n(Thus a_{n+1}=f(a_n).)  \nWe have to find every positive integer N for which the iteration\n\n N , f (N) , f (f (N)) , …                                       (1)\n\ncan be continued for ever while all terms possess at least three proper divisors.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.  When does f (n) = n ?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWrite n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2} … with p_1 < p_2 < … prime.  \nThe largest proper divisor of n is n/p_1 .  The next largest one is obtained\nby dividing n by the second–smallest divisor of n that is larger than p_1 .\n\n•  Suppose 2∤n.  \n   Then n/2 is not a divisor and the three largest proper divisors are\n   < n/3, so their sum is < n/3 + n/3 + n/3 = n ; hence f (n) < n.\n\n•  Hence every number that could possibly satisfy (1) must be even;\n   put n = 2m.\n\n   –  If 4 | n, then n/4 exceeds n/6, so the three largest proper divisors\n      are n/2 , n/3 ( if 3 | n ) and n/4 ; therefore\n\n          f (n) ≤ n/2 + n/3 + n/4 = 13n/12 > n,\n\n      so f (n) ≠ n.\n\n   –  Thus 2 exactly divides n.  Write n = 2m with m odd.\n\n   –  If 3 ∤ n, the three largest proper divisors are n/2 , n/q , n/r with\n      q ≥ 5, r ≥ q, and\n\n          f (n) ≤ n/2 + n/5 + n/6 < n,\n\n      whence again f (n) ≠ n.\n\n   –  Consequently 3 | n.  Write n = 6t ( t odd).\n\n   –  If 5 | n (i.e. 5 | t) then n/5 > n/6 and replaces n/6 in the list of\n      three largest proper divisors; we get\n\n          f (n) = n/2 + n/3 + n/5 = 31 n / 30 ≠ n .\n\n   –  Finally, if 5 ∤ n and 4 ∤ n (which is automatic because the factor 2\n      occurs only once), the three largest proper divisors are precisely\n\n          n/2 , n/3 , n/6,\n\n      whose sum is\n\n          n/2 + n/3 + n/6 = n .\n\nHence\n\n f (n) = n  ⇔  n is divisible by 6, has no factor 4 and no factor 5.   (2)\n\nIn other words\n\n n = 6t with t odd and 5 ∤ t.                                (3)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n2.  Numbers that are not of the form (3) cannot survive indefinitely\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nAssume that N is not of the form (3).  \nAccording to the discussion above, f (N) ≠ N.\n\n•  If N is not divisible by 6 or is divisible by 4 or by 5, the estimate in\n  §1 shows that f (N) is either larger than N (but by less than N/12) or\n  smaller than N; in every case one of the following happens:\n\n  –  f (N) is prime (so it has only one proper divisor); or\n\n  –  f (N)=2p with p≥5 prime.  \n    Then its proper divisors are 1, 2, p (exactly three of them) and\n\n        f (f (N)) = p + 3 ,\n\n    which is prime for p ≥ 5.\n\nThus in at most two further steps the sequence (1) reaches a number having\nfewer than three proper divisors, contradicting the hypothesis that every\nterm in (1) has at least three such divisors.\n\nTherefore an initial value N can give an infinite sequence with the required\nproperty only when N satisfies (3).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  These numbers really work\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf N satisfies (3) then, as proved in §1, f (N)=N; hence the whole sequence\nis the constant sequence N , N , N , … , and each term certainly has\nthe proper divisors N/2 , N/3 , N/6 (at least three of them).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnswer\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nAll admissible first terms are precisely the integers that are divisible by\n6, but divisible by neither 4 nor 5; equivalently\n\n a₁ = 6 t where t is odd and 5 ∤ t.

Let n = 2025.  \n(The argument is written for a general n ≥ 2; at the end we substitute n = 2025.)\n\n1.  A construction that uses 2n − 2 tiles  \n\n   Put the n uncovered unit squares on the main diagonal\n   (square (1,1), (2,2), … , (n , n)).  \n\n   •  For k = 1 , 2 , … , n − 1  \n      make a vertical tile that consists of every square that is\n      strictly below the diagonal in column k;  \n      that is, the rectangle\n\n            rows k + 1 , k + 2 , … , n\n            column k .\n\n      These are n − 1 disjoint rectangles.\n\n   •  For k = 1 , 2 , … , n − 1  \n      make a horizontal tile that consists of every square that is\n      strictly above the diagonal in row k;  \n      that is, the rectangle\n\n            row k\n            columns k + 1 , k + 2 , … , n .\n\n      These are another n − 1 disjoint rectangles.\n\n   Altogether we have (n − 1) + (n − 1) = 2n − 2\n   non-overlapping rectangles and, by construction,\n   every row and every column contains exactly one uncovered square.\n   Hence\n\n          minimum number of tiles ≤ 2n − 2.

Combining (1) and (2)  \n\n          2(n − 1) ≤ minimum number of tiles ≤ 2(n − 1).\n\n   Hence the minimum is exactly 2(n − 1).\n\n4.  Substituting n = 2025  \n\n          2(2025 − 1) = 2 · 2024 = 4048.\n\nAnswer.  The smallest possible number of rectangular tiles is 4048.
